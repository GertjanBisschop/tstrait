# Quantitative trait simulator of tree sequence data

**tstrait** is a quantitative trait simulator of tree sequence data. It supports the simulation of additive traits under the LDAK model, as described in {cite}`speed2017`. The input of the simulator will be the tree sequence structured data and the parameters that determine the nature of the quantitative trait simulation algorithm. The output will be two dataframes, where one describes the phenotypic values of individuals, and the other describes the genotypic values of causal sites.
